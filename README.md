# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Marouane, a software engineering student at 1337 (42 Network) transitioning from front-end development into systems programming, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from early web development to low-level C programming, Python automation, and system administration.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- **42 Common Core Projects**: Tackling rigorous systems programming, algorithmic challenges like `push_swap`, and virtual machine setups like `Born2beroot`.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

While I have a background in the front end, my major goal for 2026 is to master DevOps and Cloud technologies. Currently, I'm diving deep into:
- Linux systems administration and shell scripting
- Docker containerization and networking
- Advanced Python and C programming

## 🏗️ I’m looking to collaborate on

I'm open to collaborating on projects related to cloud infrastructure, DevOps tooling, Python automation, or open-source C projects. If you have an interesting project in mind, feel free to reach out!
