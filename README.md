# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Marwan Arbib, a front-end developer passionate about making productivity websites. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from websites made with only frontend skills to some websites that are made with full-stack skills, and beyond!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- [library_books]: a tracking system for your books reading more visually.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in the front end, learning more frameworks like React. Currently, I'm diving deep into the back end to get more into the web development field.
